## 1. Business Context

[Olist](https://www.olist.com) is a leading Brazilian e-commerce enabler that helps small and medium-sized businesses sell through large marketplaces like Amazon, Magalu, and Mercado Libre. By offering end-to-end infrastructure—from logistics to customer management—Olist allows sellers to scale quickly without operational overhead.

However, as Olist scales, **seller churn** becomes a critical threat. Churned sellers reduce product availability, impact customer satisfaction, and weaken marketplace competitiveness. Worse, sellers often leave silently—stopping activity without formally exiting the platform.

## 2. Business Problem
Olist needs a way to **identify at-risk sellers before they churn**. Without a churn detection system:

* Seller attrition goes unnoticed
* Engagement teams can’t intervene in time
* Marketplace supply and revenue forecasting becomes unreliable

## 3. Project Goal

Build a **binary classification model** to predict whether a seller is:

* `1 = Churned` — No orders for **N+ days**
* `0 = Active` — Still fulfilling orders

> ⚠️ *Churn is defined empirically based on observed inactivity thresholds.*

## 4. Key Questions

1. **What does the average seller lifecycle look like?**
2. **Do behavioral signals (like order volume, delays, or review scores) predict churn?**
3. **Are churn patterns linked to product category or payment method?**
4. **Can we reliably predict churn before it happens?**
5. **What features most influence churn, and how can we act on them?**

##  5. Analytical Approach

### Exploratory Analysis

* Visualized churn timing, cohort drop-offs, and seller order timelines
* Investigated review patterns, delivery delays, pricing, and category mix

### Churn Definition

* Churn defined as **45+ days of inactivity** after the last fulfilled order

### Feature Engineering

* Seller lifecycle duration, order velocity, delay stats, product diversity
* Review score distributions, category dominance, cohort tagging
* Early momentum (orders in first 34 days), payment method encoding

### Modeling

* Models tested: `LogisticRegression`, `KNN`, `DecisionTree`, `RandomForest`, `AdaBoost`, `GradientBoost`, `XGBoost`, `Voting`, `Stacking`
* Compared resampled (`RandomOverSampler`/`SMOTE`/`RandomUnderSampler`/`NearMiss`) and non-resampled performance

### Evaluation Strategy

* **F2 Score** used as the primary metric (recall-heavy)
* Grid and Randomized Search with Imbalanced Pipelines
* Confusion matrices used to interpret model tradeoffs

### Interpretation

* **Feature Importance** from Random Forest and SHAP
* Identified top churn drivers: delivery delays, review ratios, early order behavior

## 6. Results Summary

* **Best Model:** `Random Forest` without resampling
* **F2 Score (Test):** `0.792` — high recall, acceptable precision
* **Key Drivers of Churn:**

  * `std_delivery_delay`, `avg_delivery_delay` — Late shipments drive churn
  * `payment_type_debit_card` — Indicates B2B-style sellers with higher churn
  * `early_orders_34d` — Low early activity correlates with drop-off
  * `cohort_month` and `top_category` — Seasonal or product-based churn clusters

## 7. Conclusion

The churn prediction model enables Olist to:

* Detect \~80% of likely churners before disengagement
* Prioritize retention resources and target risk groups
* Save an estimated **\$80k+ per quarter** in retained seller revenue
* Build a scalable, interpretable churn monitoring system

> This project highlights that **delivery performance, seller onboarding momentum, and cohort timing** are key to seller retention.

## 8. Future Recommendations

* Add seller-level support ticket data for complaint-based churn signals
* Analyze time-series drift and re-train monthly to preserve performance
* Test interventions (discounts, outreach) on predicted churners
